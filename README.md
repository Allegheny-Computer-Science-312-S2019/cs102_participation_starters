# cs312_participation_starters


Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for course activities and /or practicals.

## Introduction
This repository contains all participation activities for the course. See participation sheets (if available) for details.

## Updates

When the course instructor provides the new material for the in-class activity, you can type this command in the main directory for this repository to pull the new material:

```
git remote add download git@github.com:Allegheny-Computer-Science-312-S2019/cs102_participation_starters
```

You should only need to type this command once; typing the command additional times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of your repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the course instructor by typing:


```
git pull download master
```

This second command can be run whenever the course instructor needs to provide you with new source code for this assignment. However, please note that, if you have edited the files that the course instructor updated, running the previous command may lead to Git merge conflicts. If this happens, you may need to manually resolve them with the help of the instructor or a teaching assistant.



## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides.

Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
